Some Statistical Functions

SELECT 
AVG(measure_value) 
FROM health.user_logs;
– Average which used to find the mean of a column in a dataset.

SELECT 
measure,
ROUND(AVG(measure_value), 2) as average,
COUNT(*) as counts
FROM health.user_logs 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
–Finding the mean of each measure to observe differences.

SELECT 
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY measure_value ) as median,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY measure_value ) as mode, AVG(measure_value) as mean 
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'weight';
– The mean of the weight measure showed inconsistencies within the dataset. The mode and median was calculated for certainties.
–0.5 is used as argument within the percentile_cont function to signify that we are trying to identify the middle number of the dataset.

SELECT 
MAX(measure_value) as maximum, 
MIN(measure_value) as minimum, 
MAX(measure_value) - MIN(measure_value) as range_value 
FROM health.user_logs 
WHERE measure = 'weight';
– Min, Max and Range are some other summary statistics function.
– Min returns the minimum value , Max returns the maximum value while range returns the difference between the maximum and minimum value in a dataset.

SELECT 
'weight' as measure, 
ROUND(MAX(measure_value), 2) as maximum_value, 
ROUND(MIN(measure_value), 2) as minimum_value, 
ROUND(AVG(measure_value), 2) as mean, 
ROUND( CAST( PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY measure_value ) AS NUMERIC ), 2 ) as median,
ROUND( MODE() WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY measure_value ), 2 ) AS mode_value, 
ROUND(STDDEV(measure_value), 2) AS standard_deviation, 
ROUND(VARIANCE(measure_value), 2) AS variance_value 
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'weight';
–Variance and Standard deviation are summary statistics used to describe the spread of data about the mean value. 
-Some values are spread either one standarr deviation, two standard deviation or three standard eviation away from the mean.

Practice Questions

1. What is the average, median and mode values of blood glucose values to 2 decimal places?
SELECT 
'blood_glucose' as measure, 
ROUND(AVG(measure_value), 2) as mean, 
ROUND( CAST( PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY measure_value ) AS NUMERIC ), 2 ) as median, 
ROUND( MODE() WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY measure_value ), 2 ) AS mode_value 
FROM health.user_logs 
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose';

2. What is the most frequently occuring measure_value value for all blood glucose measurements?
SELECT 
measure_value, 
count(*) AS frequency 
FROM health.user_logs 
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose' 
GROUP BY measure_value 
ORDER BY frequency DESC 
LIMIT 10;

3. Calculate the 2 Pearson Coefficient of Skewness for blood glucose measures given the following formulas:
WITH coefficients AS ( 
SELECT AVG(measure_value) AS mean,
ROUND( cast( PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY measure_value ) AS NUMERIC ), 2 ) AS median, 
ROUND ( mode() within group( order by measure_value ), 2 ) as mode,
ROUND(STDDEV(measure_value), 2) AS standard_deviation 
FROM health.user_logs 
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose' 
) SELECT 
(mean - mode) / standard_deviation as mode_skewness, 
3 * ((mean - median) / standard_deviation) as median_skewness
FROM coefficients;
